Year End Roundup

Howdy pardners! The end of the year is fast approachin' and we here at the
Triple-O Ranch are gettin' ready to take a short breather fer the holidays.
Before we head off, I wanted to give y'all a quick update on the state of
development and let ya know what you can look forward to in the New Year.</p>

<p>We done got the game launched a few weeks back and we're durn happy about
that.  Since then we've been ironing out a few wrinkles that poked their head
up after beta and we've been workin' on a bunch of excitin' new features.</p>

<h3 class="highlight"> Upcoming New Features </h3>

<p> I want to talk about <span class="highlight">Gangs</span> which have been
mentioned around these parts once er twice before. I reckon I can give you a
few details on what that's going to invole at least to start.</p>

<ul>
<li> Once a player has been playin' the game fer a while (exact criterion will
be explained later), they'll be able to form their own <span
class="highlight">Gang</span>. </li>

<li> Other players can join an existing Gang whenever they like, and indeed the
whole idea to have a bunch of people in a Gang, so lots of little Gangs won't
be as much fun as fewer larger Gangs. </li>

<li> Players in a Gang can hang out and chat in their Gang's
<span class="highlight">Hideout</span>. There they'll be able to browse their
Gang's info, see who's in their Gang, if they're online and where, when they
last logged on, that sort of thing. </li>

<li> In the Hideout, Gang members will be able to check out their Gang's
<span class="highlight">private Top Ranked lists</span>. So they can see who's
the best in their Gang in each of the different gameplay scenarios and
overall. </li>

<li> In the Hideout they'll also be able to play <span class="highlight">Gang
Matches</span>. In a Gang Match, players from different Gangs battle it out and
the winner of the game earns Gang Points for their Gang. Gang Points can later
be spent by the Gang Leaders to buy cool stuff for the Gang. </li>

<li> Based on the accumulation of Gang Points during Gang Matches, Gangs will
also be ranked on a <span class="highlight">Gang Leaderboard</span> so that you
can see how your Gang stacks up against the rest. </li>

<li> Players in a Gang will also be able to pool their resources to buy fancy
<span class="highlight">Gang Outfits</span>. There may even be special duds
that are only available to high ranking Gangs. </li>
</ul>

<p> In addition to Gangs, we've been doing some work on
<span class="highlight">Tournaments</span> and an exciting new feature we're
calling <span class="highlight">Bounties</span>. You'll just have to wait until
after the holidays to hear more details about those 'cause old Sheriff Mike is
only good for details on one major new feature at a time and I just done
finished tellin' ya about Gangs. </p>

<h3 class="highlight"> Patch Notes </h3>

<p> We also shipped a little patch today to fix a few bugs and tidy up some
other bits. Here are the details on that: </p>

<ul>
<li> We added a "Waiting for players to connect" window during the very beginning
of a game where before ya sometimes had to stare at a black screen. </li>

<li> We fixed some problems with picking up and dropping nuggets. </li>

<li> We added a few new badges (play more games to figger out how to get 'em). </li>

<li> We fixed the matchmaking code: it should now properly compare rankings and
not put you in a game with a player that's ranked much higher or lower than you
if you have "Near my rank" selected. </li>

<li> If you are logged off due to being idle, or because your connection to our
server failed, or because the server rebooted, we now pop up a little window
telling you want happened and allowing you to easily restart the game and log
back on. </li>

<li> We fixed a problem where Pardners could sneak into locked Back Parlors by
watchin' games and then clickin' Back to Parlor. </li>

<li> We fixed some problems with Trains and the Engineer card. We also made the
Trains move a random number of spaces between 1 and 4 every tick instead of
just one. Watch out if yer standin' on them tracks! </li>

<li> We now inform the players if tie breaker points were awarded at the end of
a game. Ties are normally broken by checking to see who did more damage during
the game, but if that's a tie too, we randomly assign an extra point to
determine the winner. </li>

<li> We tweaked the Bonus point handling a bit. If you drop a Bonus to pick up
another one, you don't get any more points. We also lowerwed the points for the
Bonus Star to 25 from 50 because we reckoned 50 was too dang much. Ya also
don't get any points fer picking up a bonus that grants an influence to yer
unit (like Lucky Horseshoe) if yer unit already has an influence. </li>

<li> We added the ability to register a complaint about another player if
they're being a dang pest. You can click on a player's avatar picture during
chat and select "Register complaint..." from the menu. </li>

<li> There are no doubt various other bug fixes and tweaks that I'm fergettin'
so if there was somethin' buggin' ya before this release, give it another shot
and see if we ain't done fixed it. </li>
</ul>

<p> Some of ya may have also noticed that we started doin' some advertisin' on
<a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com">Penny Arcade</a>. If yer a Penny Arcade
reader, then a fine Howdy to ya. We'll be doin' more advertisin' in the New
Year and hopefully you'll start seein' a heck of a lot more cowpokes turnin' up
in town. </p>

<p> That's about all I got to say to ya fer now pardners. It's late and even
the Sheriff has to sleep from time to time. Y'all be sure to enjoy yerselves
durin' the holidays and we'll do the same. Expect to see us back refreshed and
excited come the New Year.</p>

<p> Merry solstice to you and yours, </p>
