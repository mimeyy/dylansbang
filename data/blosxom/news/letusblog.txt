Meanwhile back at The Ranch

Howdy pardners! It's been a while since we made our first post and we've been
downright unblog like on this here blog. I solemnly promise to jabber on about
the fascinating details of our development process and keep y'all updated with
our progress.</p>

<p>We've been runnin' the alpha test fer a couple of weeks and it has been very
informative. Dang there are a heck of a lot of ways fer a graphics card to
freak out and we seem to be findin' all of 'em. But we're makin' progress on
that front slowly but surely and we're findin' time to polish things up and
round up them last few dogies.</p>

<p>Andrzej is busy rewritin' our 3D model handlin' code and pipeline which we
hope will give us room fer more fancy animations and allow us to support a
wider range of hardware more efficiently. Jon's been whippin' up exciting new
arenas. Rick's workin' on some fancy new animations and I've been workin' on
graphics performance as well, the tutorials and on addin' some new cards and
bonuses.</p>

<p>We'll be invitin' some more people into the alpha in the next week er so, so
keep an eye on yer inbox fer an invitation. Now if you'll excuse me I got to
head back to the Ranch and git back to work.</p>
