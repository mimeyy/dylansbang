Ridin' 'em In

We been out roundin' up them dogies for quite a while now and we reckon it's
just about time to ride 'em on in. We been fixin' bugs and polishin' up both
<span class="highlight">Frontier Town</span> and the old
<span class="highlight">Indian Trading Post</span> and we got some changes to
report:

<ul>
<li> We added a <span class="highlight">Character page</span> to the Barber
where you 'kin pick which avatar poses should be used in which situations (like
yer <span class="highlight">Victory pose</span> and yer <span
class="highlight">Wanted Poster pose</span>). You 'kin also use it to change
yer Handle if ya done picked a dud when ya first signed up. </li>

<li> We redesigned the <span class="highlight">Saloon user interface</span> to
make things a bit simpler and clearer. </li>

<li> We finished up the <span class="highlight">Friendly Folks system</span> so
now at the end of a game, you 'kin give yer opponents a thumbs up if ya like
'em real good and want to be matched with 'em again, or a thumbs down if they
bugged ya and ya don't ever want to be stuck in a game with 'em again. </li>

<li> We fancied up the <span class="highlight">Badge display</span> a bit so
that now it shows ya a shadow of Badges that ya ain't yet earned. But let it be
known that it don't show ya all the unearned Badges, just Badges from a series
that ya have at least one of already. There's plenty of surprises lurkin' in
there. </li>

<li> We also wired up some of the Card Packs in the General Store to be
unlocked by certain Badges. Most of y'all will probably already have 'em all
unlocked already but for a new player it'll add some fun and excitement when
they earn them Badges.  </li>

<li> We now display <span class="highlight">influence icons</span> next to
units in the game when they have an influence (like
<span class="highlight">Ramblin'</span> or
<span class="highlight">Hustle</span>). We already had 'em in the
<span class="highlight">Unit Status display</span> in the corner, but sometimes
it's hard to tear yer eyes away from the action long enough to look up
there.</li>

<li> We also now display a question mark over the head of a Unit when their
Advance Order is canceled because it is no longer valid. We'll also be adding a
question mark that lingers on their Unit Status display until the next time you
select the unit, but that didn't make it into this here release. </li>

<li> We wired up the <span class="highlight">Ranking Levels</span>, so now you
can see in yer <span class="highlight">Wanted Poster</span> how well ya stack
up against the other cowpokes. The ranking order is: tenderfoot, cowpoke,
Scofflaw, Rebel, Law Breaker, BANDIT, OUTLAW, RENEGADE. We'll stick that list
somewhere that folks can easily find at some point. </li>

<li> You 'kin click on the Cowpokes in the <span class="highlight">High Score
lists</span> now and check out their <span class="highlight">Wanted
Posters</span>. </li>

<li> We also added a bunch of fancy new particle effects and more great sound
effects. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<p> On top of that, we done fixed so dang many bugs that I can hardly keep
count. A great big thanks to Sheriff Mark for his hard work on that front. </p>

<p> As I mentioned at the start of this here ramble, we can finally see the
light at the end of the tunnel and we're dang close to lettin' y'all head on
over to the <span class="highlight">Indian Trading Post</span>. Here's a
screenshot of a new gameplay mode called <span class="highlight">Wendigo
Attack</span>: </p>

<p> Keep yer ears peeled and if all goes according to plan, the next thing ya
hear from me will be "Welcome to the Indian Tradin' Post!" </p>
