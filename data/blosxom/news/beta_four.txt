The Great Land Rush

Hee hee hee!  With <span class="highlight">Sheriff Mike</span> off in the
Nevada desert, no one can spoil my nefarious plot to release more beta
chaos on the unsuspecting citizens of
<span class="highlight">Frontier Town</span>!

<ul>
<li>There's a new scenario, <span class="highlight">Land Grab</span>, based on
the capture and defense of towering homesteads.  Play the Land Grab
<span class="highlight">Tutorial</span> to find out more.</li>

<li>Speaking of tutorials, you can now <span class="highlight">Practice</span>
any of the scenarios from the tutorials menu.</li>

<li>We've made a bunch of improvements to the user interface, especially with
regard to targeting units in-game.  You can see who you can shoot from each
location, whether they'll die if you shoot'em, and more!  We've also renovated
the <span class="highlight">Ranch</span>.</li>

<li>There are a bunch of purty new effects for bonuses, cards, and
nuggets.</li>

<li>A few <span class="highlight">Cards</span> have been recalled for use in
later towns.  If you had <span class="highlight">Trap</span>,
<span class="highlight">Stampede</span>,
<span class="highlight">Jack Rabbit</span>, or
<span class="highlight">Dust Devil</span> cards, well, you don't have 'em no
more.  On the bright side, players who owned any of those cards will get 1000
scrip to buy some new ones.  Cards are much cheaper now, too.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, most of our efforts are going towards <span class="highlight">Indian
Trading Post</span>, which is shapin' up real nice.  Tickets will be available
soon!</p>
