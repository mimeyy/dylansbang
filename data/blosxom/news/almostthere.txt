Beta Just 'round the Bend

Howdy y'all. We're just about ready to open the doors to the saloon and start
up our public beta. If ya haven't seen the press release then mosey on over and
<a href="http://www.threerings.net/news/20060425bangbeta.html">take a
gander</a>. We'll be commencin' the beta at <b>High Noon on May 24th</b>.
That's San Francisco time fer all you cowpokes scattered around the globe.</p>

<p>In preparation fer beta we've been spendin' a lot of our time tidyin' up
around the ranch, but that don't mean we're not makin' progress on <b>Indian
Trading Post</b>, the next town in the lineup. We'll be addin' six new units in
that town, three new gameplay modes, dozens of new boards and a whole heap of
other fancy bits. Rest yer eyes on these two new units fer a spell:</p>
