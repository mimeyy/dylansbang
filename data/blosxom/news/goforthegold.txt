Go for the Gold!

We just got some exciting new stuff into the test: the Gold Rush scenario and
some fabulous music from our good friends at
<a href="http://www.somatone.com/">Somatone</a>. We're going for a Spaghetti
Western meets break-beat sound and I think y'all are gonna dig it.</p>

<p>The Gold Rush scenario is a variation on the Claim Jumpin' scenario. In it,
each player has a claim on the board and there are various lodes where gold
nuggets appear. They pick those nuggets up with their units and take 'em back
to their claim (assuming they don't get knocked out by an opponent along the
way). As nuggets are deposited, more appear at the lodes and players battle it
out to see who can mine the most gold.</p>

<p>In Claim Jumping there are a fixed number of nuggets in play and players can
steal them from their opponents' claims which makes defense much more important
than in Gold Rush where you can just charge across the board guns a blazin' an
go after them nuggets. We're enjoying the different style and we're gettin'
started on a number of other exciting gameplay scenarios which will eventually
make their debut in the second town...</p>

<p>That's all fer now pardners.</p>
