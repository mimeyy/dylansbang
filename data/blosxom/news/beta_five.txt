Tidyin' Up

We're still workin' hard back here at the Triple-O Ranch.  We've been polishing
up the basic mechanics of the game so that it's nothing but pure fun with no
annoying rough edges, or so we hope. To that end, we got a long list of fixes
and improvements to offer up to ya today:

<ul>
<li> We added <span class="highlight">tips to the town menu</span> and prettied
up the buttons. </li>

<li> We added a fancy new <span class="highlight">in-game unit status
display</span> which gives you details like movement and firing range as well
as displays current influences, hindrances and anything being carried by your
unit. </li>

<li> We added a <span class="highlight">Friendly Folks system</span> which
we're still workin' on. This will allow you to keep track of folks you like
playing with and will make it easier for you to chat with 'em and get into
games with 'em. Think of it like bookmarks for people. </li>

<li> We added support for <span class="highlight">bridges</span> to the engine
and added some new boards that make use of 'em. </li>

<li> We added a whole heap of <span class="highlight">new avatar
looks</span>. </li>

<li> We added a bunch of <span class="highlight">new boards</span> and added
<span class="highlight">Land Grab</span> support to many of the old ones. </li>

<li> When your potential moves are displayed, we now highlight any moves that
accomplish some sort of goal (like picking up or dropping off a nugget, or
picking up a bonus) and so forth. </li>

<li> We added a <span class="highlight">recent chat</span> display which you
can open by pressing F3. </li>

<li> The tutorials can now be played in any order. </li>

<li> We added forward/back buttons to the tutorial text. </li>

<li> <span class="highlight">Saloon settings</span> are now saved between
sessions. </li>

<li> Cards brought into a game are shown in a different color than those
picked up during play. </li>

<li> We added a button for going right to <span class="highlight">The
Barber</span> after buyin' new duds at <span class="highlight">The General
Store</span>. </li>

<li> We added textual descriptions to the modifiers in unit tooltips
(it now says, for example, "Attack bonus versus range units" in addition to
showing the icons). </li>

<li> We fixed a problem with dropping in-progress chat when starting a
game. </li>

<li> We added a random name generator that you can use when namin' yer <span
class="highlight">Big Shot Units</span>. </li>

<li> We squashed the "missing avatar in chat" bug along with numerous
others. </li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>As usual, we did a whole lot of work on <span class="highlight">Indian
Trading Post</span> and we're getting closer and closer to having it ready for
ya.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, enjoy these usability improvements and the new boards and
we'll keep our noses to the grindstone here at the Triple-O Ranch,</p>
