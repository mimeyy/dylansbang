Welcome to the Indian Trading Post

<img align="right" src="/images/itp_map.png">
Pardners, we're pleased as punch to announce that
<span class="highlight">Indian Trading Post</span> is now available on the
public beta server. It's been a long road, but we're mighty happy with how it
all came together. We've introduced a pile of new stuff to the game.</p>

<p>There are three new <span class="highlight">Big Shot units</span>:

<ul>
<li> The <span class="highlight">Storm Caller</span> attacks his opponents with
a bolt of lightning that chains to anyone unlucky enough to be standin' next to
his target. </li>

<li> The <span class="highlight">Trickster Raven</span> transforms from human
to raven form to fly from place to place around the board. </li>

<li> The <span class="highlight">Revolutionary</span> is an inspiration to his
team. He gives a 10% attack bonus to all allied ground units, and when he is
killed, all currently dead units on his team are immediately respawned to
avenge him. </li>
</ul>

There are four new stock units:

<ul>
<li> The <span class="highlight">Dream Catcher</span> attacks by flinging
nightmares at her target which cause them to run in terror, reset their
initiative and drain some of their health into the Dream Catcher. </li>

<li> The <span class="highlight">Buffalo Rider</span> rams her target with a
mighty buffalo. If she starts her attack from far enough away, she'll knock
them back into the next board space. </li>

<li> The <span class="highlight">Thunderbird</span> is our first
<span class="highlight">Spirit</span> unit and has the ability to attack its
target on the way to its destination instead of moving first and then
attacking. </li>

<li> The <span class="highlight">Dog Soldier</span> is a tank of a unit that
stakes himself into the ground to avoid being moved when attacked by the
Buffalo Rider or the Dream Catcher. He also gets a small additional attack on
every tick which damages all enemy units that are standing next to him. </li>
</ul>

There are three new gameplay scenarios:

<ul>
<li> In <span class="highlight">Wendigo Attack</span> the players battle it out
while trying to survive the onslaught of the deadly
<span class="highlight">Wendigo</span>. Only by carrying a
<span class="highlight">Sacred Talisman</span> or standing on a
<span class="highlight">Petroglyph of Protection</span> can they avoid an icy
doom. </li>

<li> In <span class="highlight">Totem Building</span> players work to build the
most and the biggest <span class="highlight">Totem Poles</span> using different
kinds of <span class="highlight">Totems</span> that they pick up around the
board. </li>

<li> In <span class="highlight">Forest Guardians</span> players cooperate
rather than compete and do battle against the dastardly
<span class="highlight">Logging Robots</span> who wish to decimate the forests
to further the expansion of their
<span class="highlight">Furniture Empire</span>. </li>
</ul>

There are over a dozen <span class="highlight">new cards and bonuses</span> and
even more <span class="highlight">new badges</span> to be discovered.
</p>

<p>We'll be workin' away to fix all the bugs that will no doubt be uncovered
now that all this new code is getting some serious use. In the meanwhile, enjoy
and we'll see ya down at the <span class="highlight">Big Bear Saloon</span>,</p>
