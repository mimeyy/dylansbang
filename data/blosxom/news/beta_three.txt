Dealin' Out Some Cards

After a long spell of roundin' up them dogies, we're finally ready to drive a
herd back to the ranch. Most of our progress is still focused on the next town,
<span class="highlight">Indian Trading Post</span>, but we're also making
improvements and additions to <span class="highlight">Frontier Town</span> as
well.

<ul>
<li>We added a whole heap 'o new <span class="highlight">Cards</span> and <span
class="highlight">Bonuses</span>.  <span class="highlight">Barricade</span>,
<span class="highlight">Dud</span>, <span class="highlight">Jack Rabbit</span>,
and a dozen more. Get on into the <span class="highlight">General Store</span>
and pick up a pack fer yerself and give 'em a whirl.</li>

<li>We've made a whole lot of progress on our effects system, so a bunch more
stuff sparks, sparkles, explodes, and blings. There'll be even more of that
coming down the pike, now that we got all the right bits in place.</li>

<li>We've added some new avatar expressions and hairstyles. There's a bunch
more o' them (and fancy duds) coming in <span class="highlight">Indian Trading
Post</span> as well.</li>

<li>There are now textual descriptions of card effects reported when you play
cards or when cards are played against your units.</li>

<li>Your Mute List can now be edited from the Options panel. Players can be
muted by entering <code>/mute "Player Name"</code> in a chat window or by
clicking the mute button during player to player chat.</li>

<li>Of course we fixed a heap of bugs and no doubt added some new ones.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>We're still workin' hard on ITP, but I've got another screenshot for ya:</p>

now pardners,</p>
